I recently learned about Rails and I'm excited to do this project for a great [memory techniques](https://bobkittell.com/) business. Bob Kittell is a renowned award winning speaker and it's great to do this for him. His words are so inspiring, I owe him a lot and hope to give something in return by learning this new thing. 

Programming is very complex, but with so many tutorials out there, nothing is impossible. I'm sure Bob would be proud of me, as this is something a little beyond what I thought I'm capable of.

You should really listen to his speeches, it will improve your life for sure.
